The project was to create a virtual chat-bot assistant for an electronic store.

# Technologies used: IBM Cloud, IBM Watson assistant,NODE-Red and IBM discovery.

• The watson assistant was used for making the chat-bot.
• Node red for integration of all services.
• IBM discovery to extract information from the user manual basically the smart document understanding part.
• IBM Cloud for hosting the app and storing data in the cloudant database.

We feed the user manual to watson discovery service and train watson assistant. In this way chat-bot will be able to answer queries about the electronic store and the product.
